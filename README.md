# [Heroku Go Base Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/heroku/go)

This is a base image that includes the Go toolchain. You probably don't want/need to use this by itself and should probably use either [heroku/go](https://hub.docker.com/r/heroku/go) or [heroku/go-gb](https://hub.docker.com/r/heroku/go-gb)

## Image tags

You can see all of the tags [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/heroku/go-base/tags/).

The `latest` tag will generally refer to the latest, possibly unsupported,
release of [Go](https://golang.org/dl), including betas and release candidates.

Once a final version is cut a separate tag will be used and updated.
